We have presented \sysname, a dynamic analysis system to identify insecure keys in an input executable. \sysname first pinpoints the crypto keys by leveraging general properties of crypto operations. 
Then, it identifies insecure keys, namely, deterministic generated keys, insecurely negotiated keys, and recoverable keys by tracking how the crypto keys are generated and propagated. 
We have implemented \sysname and tested it with 10 cryptographic libraries and 15 applications that contain crypto operations. 
Our evaluation results show that \sysname pinpoints the crypto keys used by symmetric ciphers, asymmetric ciphers, stream ciphers, and digital signatures.  
More importantly, \sysname discovers insecure keys in 22 out of 25 evaluated programs, including in well-established crypto libraries such as \textsf{\small LibSodium}, \textsf{\small Nettle}, \textsf{\small TomCrypt}, and \textsf{\small WolfSSL}. 
We have responsibly disclosed the vulnerabilities to the affected software vendors and patches are under development.
