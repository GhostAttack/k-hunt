# K-Hunt: Pinpointing Insecure Cryptographic Keys from Execution Traces

This is the repository for our CCS'18 paper *K-Hunt: Pinpointing Insecure Cryptographic Keys from Execution Traces*.
The repository includes `analysis tools` (pintools and python script), `test suite` (crypto programs and libraries), `challenge-ccs18' (a crypto challenge for CCS\'18) and `tex` (tex source code, pdf, and slides) of our paper.
